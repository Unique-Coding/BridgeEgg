# BridgeEgg

A very simple plugin which adds a bridge egg custom item into the server. When you throw the egg, it will place a bridge where it goes.
All bridge eggs have a distance property and a block type property. Its distance is how far it can travel from the location it was thrown before popping in the ai.
The block type is the block data it places while it flies, such as white wool
